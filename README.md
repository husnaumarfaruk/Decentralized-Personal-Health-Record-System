# Decentralized Personal Health Record System

## Overview

The Decentralized Personal Health Record System revolutionizes healthcare data management by giving patients complete ownership and control over their medical information while ensuring secure access for authorized healthcare providers. Built on blockchain technology, this system creates a unified, comprehensive health record that transcends institutional boundaries, enhances data security, streamlines information sharing, and empowers patients to participate in medical research on their own terms.

## Core Components

### Patient Identity Contract

Establishes and maintains secure digital health identities:
- Self-sovereign identity implementation
- Biometric verification integration

- Emergency access protocols
- Identity recovery procedures
- Guardian/caretaker designation
- Minor/dependent management
- Identity evolution across life stages
- Cross-border identity recognition
- Healthcare proxy integration
- Multi-factor authentication
- Selective disclosure capabilities

### Record Access Contract

Controls permissions for viewing and updating health information:
- Granular permission management
- Time-bound access authorization
- Purpose-specific data sharing
- Provider role-based access controls
- Emergency access overrides
- Access audit trails
- Revocation mechanisms
- Delegation of access rights
- Access request workflows
- Specialized permissions for mental health, substance use, and other sensitive data
- Provider organization management
- Temporary access for specialists

### Data Integration Contract

Combines and harmonizes health information from multiple sources:
- Provider data ingestion standards
